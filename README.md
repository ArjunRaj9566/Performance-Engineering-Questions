# Performance Engineering Questions

## Overview

As a performance tester/engineer, we have to understand of almost everything about the project, application and what not. To acquire that knowledge we need to ask questions to the architects, developers, product owners etc. 

No questions are stupid, only the answers are. This repo will list out the questions you can ask to your team.

## Questions

1. What is the objective of this exercise(performance testing)?
2. Is it already available in production?
3. If it is in production, can I get access to the production logs?
4. Who are all the end users?
5. End users demographics
6. End users device preferences.
7. End users network preferences.
8. What are all the SLAs and SLOs?
9. Critical scenarios to be tested
10. Is stage or non-production environment available?
11. Is the test environment identical to the production?
12. Is the test data available?
13. Is the test data reusable?
14. Before we start the test, do we need to inform any other team?
15. List of browsers to be tested
16. Timeline for the project
17. Tech stack of the application
18. List of services and its method to be tested
19. To whom I can assign the defect?
